`create_tfstate_bucket.tf` was run only once to provision S3 bucket and DynamoDB table (for locking) for tf state. I did it just by navigation to `create_tfstate_bucket` folder and running `terraform apply` there. `create_tfstate_bucket.tf` should not be the part of CI/CD. And `terraform.tfstate` is local too, because I don't plan to add anything else, it was just to create this initial bucket and other stuff for main terraform state.
